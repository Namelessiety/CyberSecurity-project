            <p>now, before starting, you should know what phishing is and how to avoid falling for it.<br /><br />
                as defined by the computer security recourse center, phishing is
                a technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, 
                through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site,
                 in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 to avoid such attacks, you must first learn how to identify them by knowing the most common errors
                 errors and identifiers which I will sum up in 10 points being:
                 <ol>
                    <li>Grammar and Spelling Errors</li>
                    <li>Suspicious Attachments</li>
                    <li>Inconsistencies in Email Addresses, Links & Domain Names</li>
                    <li>Unusual Request</li>
                    <li>Request for Credentials, Payment Information or Other Personal Details</li>
                    <li>Threats or a Sense of Urgency</li>
                    <li>say they've noticed some suspicious activity or log-in attempts</li>
                    <li>offer a coupon for free stuff</li>
                    <li>want you to click on a link to make a payment</li>
                    <li>The email has a generic greeting</li>
                 </ol>
            </p>
        </div>

        <footer id="foot">
            <p> 
                after clicking start, youll be shown different emails and you will have to identify 
                which are real and which are not,the fake ones will have one or a combination of the points mentioned and identifying the 
                fake email will be become increasingly harder.
